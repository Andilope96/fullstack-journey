# Day 3

**Activities:**
Today I practiced problem solving using several puzzles on CodingGame and studied JavaScript code quality principles.

## CodingGame Challenges Solved
- Onboarding – https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/onboarding
- Temperatures – https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures
- Mars Lander Episode 1 – https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander-episode-1

## JavaScript Learning
I completed the full "Code Quality" module on JavaScript.info.
Resource link: https://javascript.info/code-quality

## Summary
### CodingGame Challenges


**Onboarding:**
- Basic control flow and reading input from the game engine.
- Simple loops and conditional logic.

**Temperatures:**
- Determining which number is closest to zero.
- Working with absolute values and comparison logic.
- Handling the rule: if two values are equally close, the positive one wins.

**Mars Lander Episode 1:**
- Parsing multiple values from input.
- Applying step-by-step logic to control descent speed.
- Adjusting variables based on changing conditions each iteration.

### JavaScript Code Quality (from JavaScript.info)


**Key Topics:**
1. **Coding Style & Consistency**
   - Proper naming conventions and indentation.
   - Structuring code for readability.
   - Resource: https://javascript.info/coding-style

2. **Linters & Automated Checks**
   - Tools like ESLint help detect mistakes early.
   - Ensures consistent formatting and avoids unused or unreachable code.
   - Resource: https://javascript.info/code-quality#linting

3. **Effective Comments**
   - Writing comments that explain *why*, not *what*.
   - Avoiding redundant comments when code is already clear.
   - Resource: https://javascript.info/comments

4. **Clean Logic Structure**
   - Breaking large tasks into small, focused functions.
   - Avoiding deep nesting with guard clauses.
   - Preferring clarity over cleverness.

This forms a foundation for writing professional, maintainable JavaScript.


### **1. JavaScript Objects (2 hours)**
- Learn how objects work in detail:
  - https://javascript.info/object
  - Property access, adding/removing properties
  - Nested objects
  - Looping over objects → https://javascript.info/object#the-forin-loop
- Small exercise: create an object representing a user and manipulate its values.

### **2. Introduction to Classes & Inheritance (1 hour)**
- Learn:
  - `class` syntax
  - constructor
  - methods
  - simple inheritance with `extends`
- Resource: https://javascript.info/class
- Exercise: create a `Animal` class and derive `Cat` and `Dog`.

### **3. DOM Fundamentals (2 hours)**
- Learn core DOM manipulation:
  - https://javascript.info/dom-nodes
  - https://javascript.info/modifying-document
  - Create elements, append, remove, edit attributes
- Mini exercise:
  - Create a small HTML page and dynamically add items to a list.
  - Add a delete button for each item.

### **4. Mini-Browser Project (1 hour)**
- Build a tiny app to apply what you learned:
  - "Favorite Movies List"
  - Features:
    - Input field to add a movie
    - Button to add it to the DOM
    - Each movie has a remove button
  - All logic in pure JS (no framework)

- Revisit the Temperatures puzzle and try alternative approaches.
- Explore more medium-difficulty puzzles on CodingGame.
- Apply code quality rules in a small JavaScript mini‑project.
- Automated Testing
